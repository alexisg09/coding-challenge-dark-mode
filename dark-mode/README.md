# Dark Mode Coding Challenge 🌙 &nbsp; ![medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Medium-yellow) ![time](https://img.shields.io/badge/%E2%8F%B0-30m-blue) 

&nbsp;
# Goals / Outcomes ✨
- Using state and global state
- DOM manipulation

&nbsp;
# Requirements 📖
- Add dark-mode switching functionality to the *existing* dark-mode button
- When in Dark mode:
  - The button icon should be `faSun`
  - The button icon colour should be `(#FFA500)`

&nbsp;
# Think about 💡
- How we would use Dark mode on other potential routes/components in a bigger application. Would your solution work for this?
- How we would automatically test the behaviour


&nbsp;
# What's Already Been Done 🏁
- Basic app UI (mobile responsive)
- Dark mode and light mode styles/themes

&nbsp;
